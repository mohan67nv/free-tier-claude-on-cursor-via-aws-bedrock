## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| A **Google account** | Any personal Gmail works |
| A **credit or debit card** | Required for GCP identity verification only. You will **not** be auto-charged after the free trial ends unless you manually upgrade. |
| **Python 3.8+** installed | Required for LiteLLM. Check with `python3 --version` |
| **Cursor IDE** installed | Download free at [cursor.com](https://cursor.com) |
| ~30 minutes of time | All steps are clearly explained |

> **No prior GCP or cloud experience needed.**

---

## Cost Overview

| Item | Cost |
| :--- | :--- |
| GCP account creation | $0 |
| Identity verification hold | ~$1 (returned immediately or within a few days) |
| **Google Cloud free trial credits** | **−$300** |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro daily coding usage | ~$5–$15/month, fully covered by credits |
| Claude Sonnet via Vertex AI daily use | ~$5–$20/month, fully covered by credits |
| **Your actual out-of-pocket cost** | **$0** |

> The $300 trial is valid for 90 days. After that, GCP will **not** auto-charge you — your account moves to a free tier and services stop unless you manually upgrade. At typical daily AI coding usage, $300 covers 3–6 months of heavy use.

---

## Phase 1: Get Your $300 in Free GCP Credits

> **Goal:** Activate your Google Cloud free trial to unlock $300 in credits.

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. You should see a banner: **"Get $300 in free credits"** or **"Start Free Trial"**. Click it.
4. Fill in the activation form:
   - Select your **country** and agree to the terms.
   - Enter your **credit or debit card** details. This is for identity verification only. A small temporary authorization hold may appear and will be reversed.
   - **Important:** Google will NOT auto-charge you after the trial ends. Your services simply stop.
5. Click **Start my free trial**.
6. You will land on the GCP Console dashboard with $300 in credits active.

> ✅ Your free trial credits are now live. Any Vertex AI usage in this guide will draw from this balance.

---

## Phase 2: Create a Project & Enable Vertex AI

> **Goal:** Set up a dedicated GCP project and turn on the Vertex AI API.

**Step 1 — Create a new project**

1. In the top-left of the GCP Console, click the **project dropdown** (next to the Google Cloud logo).
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Enter a name (e.g., `cursor-vertex-ai`) and click **Create**.
4. Wait a few seconds for the project to be created, then select it from the dropdown.
5. **Copy your Project ID** — it will look like `cursor-vertex-ai-a1b2c3`. You will need this later.

> The **Project ID** is shown below the project name on the project creation screen and on the dashboard. It is different from the project name.

**Step 2 — Enable the Vertex AI API**

1. In the search bar at the top of the console, type **"Vertex AI API"**.
2. Click the result that says **Vertex AI API** (from Google Enterprise APIs).
3. Click the **Enable** button.
4. Wait 30–60 seconds for the API to activate.

---

## Phase 3: Enable Models in Model Garden

> **Goal:** Unlock Gemini and Claude models for your project.

1. In the GCP Console left sidebar, navigate to **Vertex AI → Model Garden**.
   - If you do not see it, use the search bar and type "Model Garden".
2. **Enable Gemini models:**
   - Search for **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (or `gemini-2.5-pro-preview`).
   - Click the model card → click **Enable** or confirm it shows as available.
   - Repeat for **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for a faster, cheaper option.
3. **Enable Anthropic Claude models:**
   - Search for **Claude** in the Model Garden.
   - Click **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** → you will be asked to **accept Anthropic's terms of service** (a simple click-through agreement).
   - Repeat for **Claude Sonnet 4** / **Claude 3.5 Haiku** if available in your region.
4. Confirm each model shows a green status or **"Enabled"** indicator.

> ✅ Claude models on Vertex AI require accepting Anthropic's terms, but there is no extra cost and no approval waiting period.

---

## Phase 4: Set Up a Budget Alert

> **Goal:** Get an email warning before your $300 credits are significantly consumed.

1. In the GCP Console search bar, type **"Budgets & alerts"** and click it.
2. Click **Create budget**.
3. Configure:
   - **Name:** `vertex-ai-safety-net`
   - **Projects:** Select your project (e.g., `cursor-vertex-ai`)
   - **Budget type:** Specified amount
   - **Amount:** `$50`
4. Click **Next** → set alert thresholds:
   - Add threshold at **50%** ($25 spent) — early warning
   - Add threshold at **90%** ($45 spent) — urgent warning
5. Enter your email address for notifications.
6. Click **Finish**.

> You will receive email alerts at $25 and $45 spent — giving you plenty of runway before anything happens to your $300 balance.

---

## Phase 5: Install & Authenticate Google Cloud CLI

> **Goal:** Connect your local machine to your GCP project using secure credentials that LiteLLM will use automatically.

**Step 1 — Install the gcloud CLI**

Follow the official install guide for your OS: [cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

Quick install options:
```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk

# Linux (apt)
sudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli

# Windows
# Download the installer from the official docs link above
```

**Step 2 — Log in and set up Application Default Credentials**

This is the key step. Run:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

A browser window will open. Log in with your Google account and grant the requested permissions. This saves a local credential file that LiteLLM reads automatically — you never need to paste credentials into config files.

**Step 3 — Set your active project**

```bash
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with the Project ID you copied in Phase 2 (e.g., `cursor-vertex-ai-a1b2c3`).

**Verify everything is working:**
```bash
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token
```

If this prints a long token string, your credentials are valid.

---

## Phase 6: Install & Configure LiteLLM

> **Goal:** Set up LiteLLM as a local proxy that makes Vertex AI look like an OpenAI-compatible API to Cursor.

**Why LiteLLM?** Cursor's AWS Bedrock integration works natively, but for Google Vertex AI, Cursor expects an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. LiteLLM runs locally on your machine and translates Cursor's requests into Vertex AI API calls — invisibly.

**Step 1 — Install LiteLLM**

```bash
pip install 'litellm[proxy]'
```

**Step 2 — Create the configuration file**

Create a new folder for your config and add a `config.yaml` file:

```bash
mkdir ~/litellm-vertex && cd ~/litellm-vertex
```

Create `config.yaml` with the following content. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual GCP Project ID:

```yaml
model_list:
  # Gemini 2.5 Pro — Best for complex reasoning and architecture tasks
  - model_name: gemini-2.5-pro
    litellm_params:
      model: vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05
      vertex_project: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
      vertex_location: "us-central1"

  # Gemini 2.0 Flash — Fast and cheap, great for daily work
  - model_name: gemini-2.0-flash
    litellm_params:
      model: vertex_ai/gemini-2.0-flash-001
      vertex_project: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
      vertex_location: "us-central1"

  # Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Vertex AI — Balanced power and cost
  - model_name: claude-3.5-sonnet
    litellm_params:
      model: vertex_ai/claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022
      vertex_project: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
      vertex_location: "us-east5"

  # Claude Sonnet 4 via Vertex AI — Flagship for complex tasks
  - model_name: claude-sonnet-4
    litellm_params:
      model: vertex_ai/claude-sonnet-4-5
      vertex_project: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
      vertex_location: "global"
```

> **Region note:** Gemini models are widely available in `us-central1`. Claude models on Vertex AI are available in `us-east5` and `global`. Check the [Vertex AI model availability page](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations) if a region gives an error.

---

## Phase 7: Run the LiteLLM Proxy Server

> **Goal:** Start the local proxy so Cursor can talk to Vertex AI.

Navigate to the folder with your `config.yaml` and run:

```bash
cd ~/litellm-vertex
litellm --config config.yaml
```

You should see output like:
```
INFO: Started server process [12345]
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:4000
```

**Leave this terminal window open** while you use Cursor. The proxy must be running for Cursor to work.

> 💡 **Tip — Auto-start on boot (optional):** To avoid manually running this every time, you can set it up as a system service. On Linux/macOS, create a simple shell script and add it to your startup items.

---

## Phase 8: Configure Cursor IDE

> **Goal:** Point Cursor to your local LiteLLM proxy and start using Gemini and Claude for free.

1. Open **Cursor IDE**.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + J` (Mac) to open **Settings**.
3. Click the **Models** tab.
4. **Disable all default models** (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, etc.) by toggling them off. This ensures Cursor only routes requests through your proxy.
5. Scroll down to the **Add a model** section and add each model name exactly as written in your `config.yaml`:
   - `gemini-2.5-pro`
   - `gemini-2.0-flash`
   - `claude-3.5-sonnet`
   - `claude-sonnet-4`
6. Scroll down to **OpenAI API Key** and **Override OpenAI Base URL**:
   - **Override OpenAI Base URL:** Toggle **ON** → set to `http://127.0.0.1:4000`
   - **OpenAI API Key:** Enter any placeholder value, e.g. `sk-1234`

   > LiteLLM handles the real Google Cloud authentication via the `gcloud` credentials from Phase 5. Cursor just needs a non-empty API key field — the value itself does not matter.

7. Click **Verify** next to the Base URL field. If the proxy is running, it will show a success message.
8. Open a new Cursor chat, select `gemini-2.5-pro` or `claude-3.5-sonnet` from the model dropdown, and start coding.

> ✅ You are now running frontier Gemini and Claude models at $0/month out of pocket.

## Other Ways to Use These Models

### Method 2: VS Code + Continue Extension (No Cursor, No LiteLLM)

[Continue](https://continue.dev) supports Vertex AI natively in VS Code without needing a proxy.

1. Install the **Continue** extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Open `~/.continue/config.json` and add:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Gemini 2.5 Pro (Vertex)",
      "provider": "vertexai",
      "model": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05",
      "projectId": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      "region": "us-central1"
    },
    {
      "title": "Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Vertex)",
      "provider": "vertexai",
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022",
      "projectId": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      "region": "us-east5"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Continue uses your `gcloud` application default credentials automatically — no API key needed.

---

### Method 3: Python SDK (Direct Vertex AI Calls)

Use the official `google-cloud-aiplatform` SDK for scripts, notebooks, or automation:

```bash
pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
```

**Gemini via Vertex AI:**
```python
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel

vertexai.init(project="YOUR_PROJECT_ID", location="us-central1")

model = GenerativeModel("gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05")
response = model.generate_content("Explain how async/await works in Python.")
print(response.text)
```

**Claude via Vertex AI (using Anthropic's SDK):**
```bash
pip install anthropic[vertex]
```

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.AnthropicVertex(
    project_id="YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    region="us-east5",
)

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Refactor this function to be more Pythonic."}
    ],
)
print(message.content[0].text)
```

> Uses your `gcloud auth application-default login` credentials automatically — no API keys needed in code.

---

### Method 4: Google AI Studio (Gemini Only — No Setup)

For quick Gemini testing without any setup:

1. Go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Select a Gemini model and start prompting — free usage with Google account limits.

> AI Studio uses a separate free tier (not your $300 credits). It is great for one-off tasks but does not support Claude models or IDE integration.

---

### Method 5: LiteLLM with an API Key (Shareable Setup)

If you want to share the proxy or use it from multiple machines, add an API key to LiteLLM:

Update `config.yaml`:
```yaml
general_settings:
  master_key: "sk-my-secret-key"   # Set any string you choose

model_list:
  # ... your model list as before
```

Then in Cursor, set the **OpenAI API Key** field to `sk-my-secret-key` instead of a placeholder. This prevents anyone else on your network from using your proxy without the key.

---

## Troubleshooting

### LiteLLM starts but Cursor cannot connect

**Check:**
1. Confirm the proxy is running: open `http://127.0.0.1:4000` in your browser — you should see a LiteLLM status page.
2. In Cursor, make sure the Base URL is exactly `http://127.0.0.1:4000` (not `https`, not `0.0.0.0`).
3. Make sure the model names in Cursor match exactly what you wrote under `model_name:` in `config.yaml`.

---

### Error: `google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError`

**Cause:** LiteLLM cannot find your Google credentials.

**Fix:**
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Re-run this command and complete the browser login. Then restart the LiteLLM server.

---

### Error: `403 Permission denied` or `Vertex AI API not enabled`

**Cause:** The Vertex AI API is not enabled, or the model was not activated in Model Garden.

**Fix:**
1. Go to GCP Console → search **"Vertex AI API"** → confirm it shows **Enabled**.
2. Go to **Vertex AI → Model Garden** → confirm the model shows as available/enabled for your project.

---

### Error: `404 Model not found` or wrong region

**Cause:** The model is not available in the `vertex_location` specified in `config.yaml`.

**Fix:**
- For Gemini models, use `us-central1`
- For Claude models, try `us-east5` or `global`
- Check availability at [cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations)

---

### Error: `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` or quota exceeded

**Cause:** You have hit the requests-per-minute limit for the model.

**Fix:**
1. Go to GCP Console → **IAM & Admin → Quotas**.
2. Search for `Vertex AI`.
3. Find the relevant model quota and click **Edit Quotas** to request an increase.

## FAQ

**Q: Will Google charge my card automatically when the $300 trial ends?**
A: No. Google explicitly does not auto-charge when the free trial expires. Your services will simply pause. You must manually click "Upgrade" to convert to a paid account.

**Q: How long does $300 last for daily AI coding?**
A: It depends on the models you use. With Gemini Flash for ~80% of tasks and Gemini Pro or Claude Sonnet for complex work, $300 typically lasts **3–6 months** of heavy daily use.

**Q: Do I need to keep the LiteLLM terminal open?**
A: Yes — the proxy must be running for Cursor to work. You can set it up as a background service (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS, or a startup task on Windows) to avoid running it manually each time.

**Q: Can I use both AWS Bedrock and GCP Vertex AI at the same time?**
A: Yes. You can run both — use Bedrock directly in Cursor's built-in AWS integration, and Vertex AI through the LiteLLM proxy. See the [AWS guide](../aws/README.md) for the Bedrock setup.

**Q: Is Claude on Vertex AI the same as Claude on AWS Bedrock?**
A: The underlying model weights are identical. The routing, pricing, and authentication differ. Bedrock is simpler to connect directly from Cursor. Vertex AI requires the LiteLLM proxy but gives access to both Gemini and Claude in one place.

**Q: Can I use this on Mac, Windows, or Linux?**
A: Yes. The gcloud CLI, Python, and LiteLLM all work on all three platforms.
